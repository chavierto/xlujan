			'First place winner in a recent Hackathon tackling healthcare in a remote world. Using the prompt #RemoteHealthcareAccess, my team worked for three days ideating, designing and building "2ndOpinion". Inspired by the story of a patient who was misdiagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer and underwent 18 months of chemotherapy and its side effects, we developed a platform that lets patients get a second opinion on their diagnoses from medical professionals.',

			"Tern is a to-do app I made in collaboration with three other developers. We wanted to have a place where we could add to-do items and be able to edit them and mark them as complete. We then though about adding a number value so we could prioritize items and give them a visual reference of the priority. Finally, we added a to-do view and a completed view, in order to only see relevant to-do's. I worked primarily on the backend, where we used MongoDB, Mongoose and Express (and React on the frontend), resulting in the ability to perform full CRUD operations to the database in order to add, edit and delete to-do items.",
